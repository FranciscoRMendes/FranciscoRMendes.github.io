excerpt: "A review of Haruki Murakami's Kafka On The Shore"
---

# Introduction
A while ago I came across a collection of Murakami's short stories in a quaint New York bookstore (that was going out of business, no less). This was my first experience with a Murakami novel. For the unininitiaed
(like I was) Murakami's style is a blend of magical realism, surrealism and a heavy dose of the every day banality that makes up a large chunk of the human lived experience. 
Overall the experience was good enough for me to grab a Murakami novel off my aunt's bookstand and read my way through it over the 4th of July holiday. What follows are some of my thoughts about 
_Kafka on the Shore_. 

# Plot 

The book has two interrelated plots, one of Kafka Tamura the titular and main character. The other is Saturo Nakata. The story opens with Kafka running away from home and changing his name (he changes his name to Kafka and we never really learn his real name). 
What follows are his adventures after leaving home, we are informed of a troubled past wherein his mother left with his sister thereby abandoning Kafka. 
Each chapter of Kafka's adventure is interleaved with the experience of Nakata, an old man who has the strange ability to speak with cats. The result of a childhood affliction following a strange celestial event. 
The two stories are on a collision course throughout the novel. We learn just enough of both stories to learn how they might be connected, and indeed Nakata is inexorably drawn to Kafka and spends much of the novel trying to reach him (even as Kafka tries to run away).

# Analysis 

Here, I must confess that I had several issues with Murakami's style. While the blend of magical realism and surrealism make for quite compelling reading, I fear that the page turning nature of the book was rather more due to the pace and unanswered questions of the story rather that the style of writing itself. 
Murakami gives the reader multiple blank checks, for instance. 
1. The mysterious event in the Yamanashi Prefecture that inexplicably leads to Nakata's ability to speak to cats 
2. The entrace stone that draws Nakata to it and the creature that crawls out of it
3. The multitude of garishly outlandish characters such as Colonel Sanders (whom you may know from KFC) and Johnnie Walker (another rather well known figure, I am told. I wouldn't know).
4. The connection between Kafka and Nakata 

For 1,2 and 3 we are given no explanation, sadly these checks could not be cashed, so to speak. While magical realism and surrealism are Murakami's metiere, it felt almost like the story was not believable even unto itself. To me this is an invoiolable rule of story telling. 
A story must be real to itself, if not necessarily to its readers. One must acknowledge that these literary elements are all part of some mystical whole. Unfortunately, this missed me by some margin. 
In effect, it felt like a surrealist drama that played out in front of an audience and then abruptly ended. As the book does, with the last couple of chapters a hurried conclusion. To be honest, had it not been for the introduction of the worm like creature that exited the entrance stone, I probably would have forgiven the book its (many) faults. 
However, the sudden introduction of that creature along with the lack of explanation for many other plot points led me to almost fling the book down in disgust. 
Magical realism was meant to use fantastical settings to explore deeper themes, however, Murakami uses them as a device to advance the plot without reconciling them together. In the absence of such an effort, it became difficult for me as the reader to accept the "magical" elements as "real", even in the context of the book. 

Things were not all bad however, for the first three quarters of the book, the magic _felt real_.
