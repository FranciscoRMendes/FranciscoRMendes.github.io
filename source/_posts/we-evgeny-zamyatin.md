It is hard to write this book review without over using superlatives. Widely regarded as the inspiration for both 1984 and Brave New World, this book is the template for revolution in a dystopian world with an all encompassing police state. 
Written during the early years of the Soviet Union, this book has the dubious distinction of being the among the first (or maybe even the first) to be banned by the Communist Party.
I have been on a bit of a tear of Soviet literature of late and this book has been on my list for some time. I am probably not the target demopgraphic of msot modern science fiction, but this book is so much more than that. 

# Plot 
The translation conveys an enthusiastic, eager albeit halting and dismembered tone. This accurately reflects D-503's (the protagonist) hurried journal entries, which form chapters in the novel. 
The book is set in 2600AD just after the 200 Years War (a war to end all wars) that was concluded by the formation of One State, a totalitarian state where everything , including sex, happens according to a fixed schedule regulated by a complex network of bureaucracies. 
Refreshingly for a science fiction book the protagonist is not unhappy with status quo, he embraces it and enjoys it. The One State aligns with his ideas of order, method and rationality. Everything changes when he meets and subsequently falls in love with I-333. 
While both 1984 and BNW have similar female characters, the sexual attraction of I-333 is but a small facet of her complex appeal to D-503. She represents a curve in his life of straight lines and right angles. She is a violation of the order he holds so dear, yet he finds himself so irresistibly drawn to her.

# Major Themes
The obvious metaphors of One State to the Soviet police state are compelling, as are D-503's eulogies to their necessity and importance in daily life. This is an important difference to most dystopian fiction that often reflects the downsides of dystopia but none of their motivating factors. Here we have the 
diary and journal entries of a true believer, we are treated with extensive philosophical insight into why One State exists and why it is good. 

_“The only means of ridding man of crime is ridding him of freedom.”_

The idea that elimination of freedoms is the only way to rid man of crime is a recurrent theme in the book, of the many references to Christianity in this book, I found this to be the most compelling. Religion (and personal morality) only exists when there is freedom, without freedom there is no need for personal morality. Which is why One State was so successful, it obviated the need 
for religion, by eliminating all personal freedoms. 

In the modern Western world, we often take it for granted that individual freedoms are the most basic right. This book asks the reader to challenge that idea substantively via conversations with I-333. 
One of the less understood ideas of communism is the importance of the collective, an idea almost incomprehensible to those educated primarily in Western philosophy. There is a scene in HBO's Chernobyl where hundreds of workers scrape the top of the Nuclear plant of radioactive debris in 
what seems to be an irrational disregard for personal safety all for the greater good of the Soviet Union that captures this sentiment, this book re-iterates that theme across many different mundane freedoms, such as the right to privacy, right to procreate and the right to choose how to lead one's life. 

_“We comes from God, I from the Devil.”_

The above quote captures that sentiment _better_ than the scene from Chernobyl does. It is interesting that Zamyatin chose this particular turn of phrase, but it corresponds to an idea in the Eastern Orthodox church that faith can only exist as a collective not as an individual. 

When referring to belief in God, "I" is almost never used in the Orthodox Church. That is why there is no "_I_ believe in God", there is only "_we_ believe in God", in Orthodox prayer. 

This theme often occurs in juxtaposition with another one, the contrast and similarity between religion and science. This is directly at odds with most of what we now experience in the West.
Science and Individual Freedom are the core tenets of most modern societies, however, Zamyatin portrays these ideas as fundamentally in conflict with each other. To One State, science would measure every aspect of the human experience, and make cold blooded calculations of cost and benefit. 
And remove the benefit at any cost. What does it matter if one life is lost as long as the lives of countless others are preserved? Science allows us to measure everything, why not the human experience. 
Gradually the belief in the Science of One State that obscures its rationale and assumptions. 

_“knowledge, absolutely sure of its infallibility, is faith”_

And that a move away from the safety and comfort of rational science is a nightmare to him

_“Now I no longer live in our clear, rational world; I live in the ancient nightmare world, the world of square roots of minus one.”_

In addition, to the philosophical metaphors the books is rife with references to mathematics in the form of the Taylor and Maclaurin series, which form part of the broader mathematical narrative that is woven around life in One State. 
This is still relevant almost a 100 years after the book was written, the desire to quantify and measure the human experience is probably something innate to those who apply science to other more tangible fields.
