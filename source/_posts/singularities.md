# Introduction
It is often difficult to speak about things like singularities because of their prevalence in pop culture. Oftentimes a concept like this takes a life of its own, forever ingrained in ones imagination as a still from a movie (for me this is that scene from Inception where they encounter Gargantua for the first time). Like many concepts in theoretical physics, popular culture is often better at bringing them into light than it is at bringing them into focus. In this article I will try to explain in simple terms what a singularity is and how that relates to physical reality. 
As always, I will give an exact example of the singularity by means of an equation. 
# Mathematical Singularities

Example 1: Singularity of $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$

1\. **Behavior of the Function:**

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$$

\- As $x \to 0^+$ (approaching from the positive side):
$$f(x) \to +\infty$$ - As $x \to 0^-$ (approaching from the negative
side): $$f(x) \to -\infty$$

At $x = 0$, the function becomes infinitely large (or small), making
$x = 0$ a singularity. This is a **pole** of the function where the
value tends to infinity.

2\. **Undefined at the Singularity:**

The function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ is **undefined** at $x = 0$, which is
the point of discontinuity.

In mathematics, singularities are not a huge problem, since pure mathematics is often abstract and does not need to be analyzed further.
