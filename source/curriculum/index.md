# Current Role


In my current role at Renesas Electronics America, I am responsible for delivering deployable neural network solutions to our clients through our user-friendly subscription-based software. Our tools allow users to upload sample data, train a neural network, evaluate its accuracy, and deploy it to their embedded systems with just a few clicks.

On the research side, I focus on developing and maintaining neural networks that are both highly accurate and efficient in terms of power consumption and memory usage. On the development side, I manage the entire codebase that supports the backend of our user-facing software. My responsibilities include:

1. Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code with my team.
2. Documenting code thoroughly to make it easy to understand.
3. Testing the code rigorously, ensuring tests are easy to run and comprehend, and verifying that the code consistently meets performance benchmarks on previous client datasets.
4. Integrating the code seamlessly with our user-facing software.
5. Integrating the code seamlessly with our clients' embedded systems.

# My Journey

My journey into data science began as an applied mathematician minimizing loss functions, namely the loss function to minimize the reconstruction loss of matrix factorization.
